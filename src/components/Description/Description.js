      <p>
        I'm just a guy who loves to code.I have 2.5 years of experience as an
        application developer where I've picked up a wide range of skils from
        web development to Big Data Technologies. Outside of work,I like to
        idulge myself in learning and implementing machine learning algorithms.
        I've done several courses and projects in machine learning and aspire to
        be a Machine Learning engineer one day. Last but not the least, I'm good
        at sports and hit the gym regularly:P.
      </p>
